ðŸš€ Rocketship is an **openâ€‘source testing engine** that can verify complex, API-driven scenarios that are made by your customersâ€” or your systems. Today's world is filled with event-driven micro-services that can be hard to test. Rocketship brings durable execution backed by **Temporal** to your testing infra, and offers an extensible plugin system so you can add the APIs and protocols that matter to you.

Define your test scenarios as **declarative YAML specs** -> and have Rocketship run them locally or in your cloud environment.

Core features:

- **Rocketship CLI** Run the engine locally or connect to a remote address.
- **Deploy-Ready Images** Need long-running, highly scalable tests? Or just want to save their history? Host Rocketship on your own infra.
- **Declarative YAML** Define your test scenarios as declarative YAML specs.
- **Durable Execution** Need a test step to retry? Or a test to run for 10 hours? No problem!
- **Plugin Ecosystem** Add the APIs and protocols that matter to you.

## Getting Started

```js
import http from "k6/http";
import { check, sleep } from "k6";

// Test configuration
export const options = {
  thresholds: {
    // Assert that 99% of requests finish within 3000ms.
    http_req_duration: ["p(99) < 3000"],
  },
  // Ramp the number of virtual users up and down
  stages: [
    { duration: "30s", target: 15 },
    { duration: "1m", target: 15 },
    { duration: "20s", target: 0 },
  ],
};

// Simulated user behavior
export default function () {
  let res = http.get("https://quickpizza.grafana.com");
  // Validate response status
  check(res, { "status was 200": (r) => r.status == 200 });
  sleep(1);
}
```

You can run scripts like this on the CLI, or in your CI, or across a Kubernetes cluster.

## Documentation

The docs cover all aspects of using k6. Some highlights include:

- [Get Started](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/). Install, run a test, inspect results.
- [HTTP requests](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/http-requests/). Have your virtual users use HTTP methods.
  Or, check the other [Protocols](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/protocols/).
- [Thresholds](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/thresholds/). Set goals for your test, and codify your SLOs.
- [Options](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/k6-options/). Configure your load, duration, TLS certificates, and much, much more.
- [Scenarios](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/scenarios/).
  Choose how to model your workload: open models, closed models, constant RPS, fixed iterations, and more.
- [Results output](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/results-output/). Study, filter, and export your test results.
- [JavaScript API](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/). Reference and examples of all k6 modules.
- [Extensions](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/extensions/). Extend k6 for new protocols and use cases.

These links barely scratch the surface!
