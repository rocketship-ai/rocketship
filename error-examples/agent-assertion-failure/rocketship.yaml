name: Agent Plugin - Assertion Failure
description: |
  This test demonstrates what happens when an agent assertion fails.
  Expected: The test should FAIL because 2+2 does not equal 5.

tests:
  - name: "Agent assertion that will fail"
    steps:
      - name: "Verify 2+2 equals 5 (impossible)"
        plugin: agent
        config:
          prompt: "Calculate 2+2 and verify the result equals 5"
        # The agent will return {"ok": false, "error": "..."}
        # which causes this step to fail
