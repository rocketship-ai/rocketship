# Rocketship Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** January 10, 2026  
**Effective Date:** January 10, 2026

These Terms of Service (these **“Terms”**) govern access to and use of the Rocketship Cloud hosted service (the **“Service”**), Rocketship websites, and related products and services we provide (collectively, the **“Services”**).  
The open source Rocketship software is licensed separately under the MIT License and is **not** governed by these Terms (see **Section 2.4**).

If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization (a company, employer, or other entity), you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that organization to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “Customer” refer to that organization.

> **Important:** These Terms include a dispute resolution and arbitration clause and a class action waiver in **Section 17**, which affects your legal rights. Please read carefully.

## 2. Scope of These Terms

### 2.1 Services Covered
These Terms apply to the Rocketship Cloud hosted service, any Rocketship web application, and our websites that link to these Terms.

### 2.2 Who These Terms Are For
The Services are intended for **business-to-business (B2B)** use. You represent that you are using the Services for professional or business purposes and not as a consumer for personal, family, or household use.

### 2.3 US-Only Availability (Geographic Restriction)
The Services are offered **only to organizations located in the United States**. You represent and warrant that you and your Authorized Users are located in the United States when accessing or using the Services. We may deny access, suspend, or terminate accounts we believe are outside the United States.

> Even with this restriction, users outside the U.S. may attempt to access the Services. If that happens, such access is at the user’s own initiative and risk, and you understand we process and store data in the United States.

### 2.4 Open Source Rocketship Software
Rocketship includes open source components and may be distributed under the **MIT License** (the **“Open Source Software”**). Use of the Open Source Software is governed by its applicable open source license(s), not these Terms. These Terms apply only to the hosted Services (e.g., Rocketship Cloud) and any proprietary features we provide.

### 2.5 Changes to the Services
We may modify the Services from time to time, including adding, removing, or changing features, limits, or supported integrations. We may also introduce new offerings that may be subject to additional terms.

### 2.6 Changes to These Terms
We may update these Terms occasionally. If we make a material change, we’ll take reasonable steps to notify you (for example, by posting the updated Terms and updating the “Last Updated” date, or by email). Continued use of the Services after the update becomes effective means you accept the updated Terms.

---

## 3. Eligibility and Account Registration

### 3.1 Minimum Age
You must be at least **16** years old to use the Services. If you are under 18, you represent you have permission from a parent or legal guardian to use the Services on behalf of an organization (if applicable).

### 3.2 Account Registration and Security
You must provide accurate, complete, and current information when creating an account and keep it up to date. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of account credentials and for all activities under your account.

### 3.3 Authentication and Access
Today, we support **GitHub OAuth** for sign-in. We may add other authentication methods in the future. You agree that we may rely on your identity provider (e.g., GitHub) for authentication and account linking, subject to **Section 7** (Third-Party Services).

---

## 4. Organizations, Admins, and Authorized Users

### 4.1 Organization Structure
The Services are organized around **Organizations** and **Projects**. An Organization may have multiple Projects.

### 4.2 Admins and Invitations
Organization administrators (**“Admins”**) may invite other users via email and assign access. You are responsible for your Admins’ and Authorized Users’ actions and compliance with these Terms.

### 4.3 Responsibility for Authorized Users
You are responsible for ensuring that only authorized individuals access your account and that each Authorized User uses unique credentials (no credential sharing).

---

## 5. Customer Content and Data

### 5.1 Customer Content
**“Customer Content”** means any data, code, test definitions (e.g., YAML), configuration, environment variables, logs, results, artifacts (screenshots, videos, traces), messages, and other content that you or your Authorized Users upload to, transmit through, or store in the Services.

Customer Content may include personal information (e.g., names/emails) and may include **your application source code or portions of it**, and data that your tests interact with or capture.

### 5.2 Your Responsibilities for Customer Content
You represent and warrant that:
- you own or have all rights to provide Customer Content to us and to grant the licenses in these Terms;
- your use of the Services and Customer Content complies with all applicable laws, regulations, and third-party terms; and
- you have obtained all necessary consents and provided all required notices for any personal information included in Customer Content.

You are responsible for configuring your tests and environments safely. **Do not** upload or process:
- highly sensitive personal information (e.g., Social Security numbers, government IDs, financial account numbers),
- protected health information under HIPAA,
- or other sensitive regulated data unless we have expressly agreed in writing.

### 5.3 License to Use Customer Content
You grant Rocketship a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid, transferable, sublicensable license to host, store, process, transmit, copy, modify (e.g., to format and generate artifacts), and display Customer Content **only as necessary** to:
- provide, maintain, and improve the Services;
- prevent or address security issues, fraud, abuse, or technical problems;
- comply with legal obligations; and
- provide support at your request.

### 5.4 Access for Support and Operations
We may access your account and Customer Content to provide support, to maintain the Services, to investigate suspected abuse, and to comply with law. We do not use Customer Content to market to your end users.

### 5.5 Data Retention and Deletion
By default, we may retain Customer Content and artifacts for up to **90 days** (including logs and test artifacts), unless required for longer to comply with law or for legitimate business needs such as security, dispute resolution, and backup integrity.

If you cancel the Services or request account deletion, we will delete or de-identify your Customer Content from active systems within **15 days**, subject to reasonable exceptions (e.g., backups, security logs, or legal requirements). Backup copies may persist for a limited period and will be deleted in the ordinary course of backup rotation.

### 5.6 Aggregated/De-Identified Data
We may create and use aggregated and/or de-identified data derived from usage of the Services (that does not identify you or your end users) for analytics, benchmarking, and improving our Services.

## 6. Acceptable Use

You agree not to misuse the Services. You must not, and must not permit others to:

- **Unauthorized testing:** Run tests, scans, or automated actions against systems you do not own or do not have permission to test.  
- **Security abuse:** Upload malware, exploit code, or attempt to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of the Services, except with our written permission.

- **Reverse engineering:** Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract source code from the Services (except to the extent permitted by law).  
- **Resale or competing service:** Sell, resell, rent, or lease the Services, or use the Services to provide a hosted/managed service to third parties, without our written permission.  
- **Abusive automation:** Use the Services in a way that materially exceeds reasonable request volume, causes undue load, or attempts to circumvent limits.  
- **Infringement:** Upload content that infringes intellectual property or other rights of others.

We may investigate violations and may suspend or terminate accounts as described in **Section 10**.

## 7. Third-Party Services (including GitHub)

The Services integrate with third-party services (for example, **GitHub**, cloud providers, analytics vendors, email providers, and payment processors). Your use of third-party services is governed by their terms and privacy policies.

This may include repository metadata, source code, pull request information, and webhooks, as needed to provide the Services.
