## 1. Scope and Key Concepts

### 1.1 What This Policy Covers
This Policy applies when you:
- visit our websites (including marketing pages, docs, blog);
- sign in to or use Rocketship Cloud;
- connect third-party integrations (e.g., GitHub);
- contact support; or
- attend events or receive communications from us.

### 1.2 Customer Content vs. End-User Data
Rocketship Cloud is a developer tool. When you run tests, you may upload or generate **Customer Content** (such as code, logs, artifacts, and captured application data). That content may include personal information about you, your teammates, or your end users. Your organization is responsible for ensuring appropriate notices and consents for any personal information included in Customer Content.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

The information we collect depends on how you use the Services.

### 2.1 Information You Provide
We may collect:
- **Account information:** name, work email, organization name, role/title (if provided), profile info.  
- **Support communications:** messages, attachments, and information you share with us when requesting support.  
- **Billing information:** billing contact details and payment-related metadata (payments are processed by **Stripe**; we generally do not store full payment card numbers).  
- **Invitations:** email addresses you provide to invite teammates.

### 2.2 Information From Integrations (e.g., GitHub)
If you connect GitHub (OAuth and/or install our GitHub App), we may collect and access:
- GitHub user/organization identifiers,
- repository metadata,
- pull request and commit metadata,
- webhooks and installation identifiers,
- and **repository content/source code** to the extent you authorize and it is needed to provide the Services.

### 2.3 Information Collected Automatically
We may automatically collect:
- **Device and usage data:** IP address, browser type, device identifiers, timestamps, pages/screens viewed, feature usage, clicks, and performance metrics.  
- **Log data:** diagnostic logs, error reports, and audit events.  
- **Approximate location:** inferred from IP address (city/state level).

### 2.4 Customer Content (Testing Inputs and Artifacts)
As you requested, assume Rocketship Cloud may receive and store **all** content used in or produced by the Services, including:
- test definitions (e.g., YAML),
- logs and outputs,
- screenshots, videos, traces, HAR files, or similar artifacts,
- HTTP request/response data (including headers and bodies),
- environment configuration and variables,
- and any application content your tests interact with or capture.

> **Important:** Avoid including sensitive regulated data (e.g., health data, SSNs, payment card data) in tests unless you have explicit written agreement from Rocketship.

### 2.5 Marketing and Sales Information
If you sign up for newsletters, request a demo, or interact with marketing, we may collect contact details and engagement data (e.g., whether you opened an email).

---

## 3. How We Use Information

We use information to:

- **Provide and operate the Services** (authentication, account management, running tests, storing artifacts, collaboration).  
- **Improve and develop the Services** (debugging, performance monitoring, product analytics, feature development).  
- **Personalize and measure marketing** (marketing emails, ads, attribution, website analytics).  
- **Security and abuse prevention** (fraud detection, investigating suspicious activity, enforcing our Terms).  
- **Customer support** (responding to requests, troubleshooting, service notices).  
- **Legal compliance** (comply with law, enforce agreements, and protect rights and safety).

---

## 4. How We Disclose Information

We may disclose information to:

### 4.1 Service Providers (Vendors / Subprocessors)
We use third-party vendors to operate the Services. Depending on what you use, this may include vendors for:
- cloud hosting and storage,
- observability/logging,
- error monitoring,
- customer support systems,
- email delivery,
- analytics and advertising,
- identity/authentication,
- and payment processing (**Stripe**).

We require service providers to protect information and use it only to provide services to us.

> **Note:** We have not finalized all vendors. We may update our vendors over time.

### 4.2 Affiliates and Business Transfers
If we’re involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of assets, information may be transferred as part of that transaction.

### 4.3 Legal and Safety
We may disclose information if we believe disclosure is necessary to:
- comply with law or legal process,
- protect the rights, property, or safety of Rocketship, our customers, or others,
- investigate and prevent fraud, security incidents, or abuse.

### 4.4 With Your Direction
We may disclose information when you instruct us to do so (e.g., enabling a third-party integration).

## 5. Cookies, Analytics, and Advertising

### 5.1 Cookies and Similar Technologies
We use cookies and similar technologies to:
- keep you signed in,
- remember preferences,
- understand how the Services are used,
- and support marketing/advertising measurement.

### 5.2 Analytics
We use analytics tools to understand usage and improve the Services. These tools may collect device and usage information as described above.

### 5.3 Advertising and Marketing Pixels
We may use marketing pixels and advertising partners to measure performance of campaigns and to reach people who may be interested in Rocketship (for example, through retargeting). This may involve sharing identifiers and usage data with advertising partners.

### 5.4 Managing Cookie Preferences
Where required, we will provide cookie controls (such as a banner or settings). You can also limit cookies through your browser settings, though some features may not work properly.

We also honor opt-out signals where required by law, including **Global Privacy Control (GPC)**, for uses that constitute “sale” or “sharing” under certain state laws (see **Section 10**).

---

## 6. Data Retention

We retain information for as long as reasonably necessary to provide the Services and for legitimate business purposes, such as maintaining security, complying with legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing agreements.

**Default retention:** Customer Content and artifacts may be retained for up to **90 days**.  
**Deletion after cancellation/request:** We generally delete Customer Content from active systems within **15 days**, subject to reasonable exceptions (e.g., backups, legal requirements, and security logs).

---

## 7. Security

We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information. However, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

If you suspect unauthorized access to your account, contact us at **support@rocketship.sh**.

---

## 8. International Transfers and US-Only Availability

Rocketship Cloud is offered only to U.S. organizations, and we process and store information in the **United States**. If you access the Services from outside the U.S., you understand your information will be transferred to and processed in the U.S., which may have different data protection laws than your jurisdiction.

We do not currently offer data residency or region selection.

---

## 9. Your Privacy Choices and Rights

Depending on your location and applicable law, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or receive a copy of certain personal information.

You can:
- **Update account information** via the Services (where available).  
- **Opt out of marketing emails** using the “unsubscribe” link or by contacting us.  
- **Request access or deletion** by emailing **support@rocketship.sh**. (We may need to verify your identity and authority.)

Because Rocketship Cloud is generally used through an organization, your requests may be routed through (or require approval from) your Organization Admin.

## 10. California Privacy Notice (CCPA/CPRA)

This section applies to California residents to the extent Rocketship is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act as amended by the CPRA (**“CCPA”**).

### 10.1 Categories of Personal Information We Collect
In the last 12 months, we may have collected:
- **Identifiers:** name, email, IP address, device identifiers.  
- **Commercial information:** billing contact details and transaction metadata.  
- **Internet or network activity:** browsing/usage data, logs, analytics events.  
- **Professional information:** company name, job title (if provided).  
- **Inferences:** derived usage insights (e.g., product analytics).  
- **Sensitive personal information:** We do not intend to collect sensitive personal information, but Customer Content may include it if you choose to include it. We ask customers not to include sensitive regulated data unless expressly agreed.

### 10.2 Purposes for Collection/Use
We collect and use personal information for the purposes described in **Section 3** (operate services, improve, support, security, marketing, legal compliance).

### 10.3 “Selling” or “Sharing”
CCPA defines “sell” and “share” broadly. We **do not sell** personal information for money. However, our use of certain advertising/marketing tools may be considered “sharing” for cross-context behavioral advertising.

California residents may opt out of such “sharing” by:
- emailing **support@rocketship.sh** with the subject “CCPA Opt-Out,” and/or
- using cookie controls (where available), and/or
- enabling **Global Privacy Control (GPC)** in your browser (where supported).

### 10.4 Your CCPA Rights
Subject to exceptions, you may have the right to:
- know what personal information we collect, use, disclose, and share;  
- request access to or deletion of personal information;  
- correct inaccurate personal information;  
- opt out of “sharing” (and “selling,” if applicable); and  
- not be discriminated against for exercising your rights.

To submit a request, email **support@rocketship.sh**. We will verify your request (which may include verifying your email and your relationship to the account). Authorized agents may submit requests on your behalf with appropriate proof of authorization.

## 11. Children’s Privacy

The Services are not directed to children and are not intended for individuals under **16**. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us and we will take appropriate steps to delete it.

## 12. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will take reasonable steps to notify you (for example, by updating the “Last Updated” date and/or providing notice in the Services).
