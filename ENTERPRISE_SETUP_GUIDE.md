## 🔐 Step 1: OIDC Provider Setup

Choose your organization's identity provider and follow the appropriate setup:

### Option A: Auth0 Setup

1. **Create Auth0 Account**

   - Go to [auth0.com](https://auth0.com) → Sign Up
   - Choose tenant name: `yourcompany-rocketship`

2. **Create Application**

   - Applications → Create Application
   - Name: `Rocketship Enterprise`
   - Type: **Native**

3. **Configure Application**

   ```
   Allowed Callback URLs: http://localhost:8000/callback
   Allowed Logout URLs: http://localhost:8000/callback
   Allowed Web Origins: http://localhost:8000
   Grant Types: ✓ Authorization Code, ✓ Refresh Token
   ```

4. **Note Your Configuration**
   ```bash
   Domain: your-tenant.auth0.com
   Client ID: [copy from Auth0 dashboard]
   Client Secret: [leave empty for PKCE]
   ```

## 🔒 Step 2: SSL Certificate Setup

Choose your certificate approach based on your environment:

### Option A: Self-Signed Certificates (Development/Internal)

```bash
# Clone and build Rocketship
git clone https://github.com/rocketship-ai/rocketship.git
cd rocketship
git checkout add-auth
make install

# Generate self-signed certificate
rocketship certs generate --domain localhost --self-signed
```

### Option B: Let's Encrypt Certificates (Production)

**Prerequisites**: You need a domain name (e.g., `rocketship.yourcompany.com`)

```bash
# Install cloudflared for local validation
# macOS:
brew install cloudflared

# Linux:
curl -L https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb -o cloudflared.deb
sudo dpkg -i cloudflared.deb

# Generate Let's Encrypt certificate with local tunnel
rocketship certs generate --domain rocketship.yourcompany.com --email it@yourcompany.com --local
```

**Follow the DNS setup prompts**:

1. Command will show a tunnel URL (e.g., `https://abc123.trycloudflare.com`)
2. Update your DNS: Create CNAME record `rocketship.yourcompany.com → abc123.trycloudflare.com`
3. Wait for DNS propagation (1-5 minutes)
4. Press Enter to complete certificate generation

```bash
# Verify certificate
rocketship certs status
```

## 🐳 Step 3: Docker Environment Setup

### 3.1 Clean Start (Important!)

**For a fresh deployment**, always start with a clean environment to avoid database conflicts:

```bash
# Clean any previous deployment (removes containers and persistent data)
./.docker/rocketship clean
```

### 3.2 Configure Environment

Create the environment configuration for your deployment:

```bash
# Navigate to Docker directory
cd .docker

# Create environment configuration
cat > .env.add-auth << 'EOF'
### BASE CONFIGURATION ###
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=rocketship-production

### OIDC CONFIGURATION ###
# Replace with your identity provider settings
ROCKETSHIP_OIDC_ISSUER=https://your-tenant.auth0.com/
ROCKETSHIP_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
ROCKETSHIP_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=
ROCKETSHIP_ADMIN_EMAILS=admin@yourcompany.com,it@yourcompany.com

### HTTPS/TLS CONFIGURATION ###
ROCKETSHIP_TLS_ENABLED=true
ROCKETSHIP_TLS_DOMAIN=localhost

### DATABASE CONFIGURATION ###
# Auth Database
AUTH_DB_HOST=auth-postgres
AUTH_DB_PORT=5432
AUTH_DB_NAME=auth
AUTH_DB_USER=authuser
AUTH_DB_PASSWORD=authpass

# Temporal Database
TEMPORAL_DB_HOST=temporal-postgres
TEMPORAL_DB_PORT=5432
TEMPORAL_DB_NAME=temporal
TEMPORAL_DB_USER=temporal
TEMPORAL_DB_PASSWORD=temporal

### DEVELOPMENT SETTINGS ###
ROCKETSHIP_LOG=INFO
EOF
```

**For Let's Encrypt certificates**, update the TLS domain:

```bash
# Update for your domain
sed -i 's/ROCKETSHIP_TLS_DOMAIN=localhost/ROCKETSHIP_TLS_DOMAIN=rocketship.yourcompany.com/' .env.add-auth
```

### 3.3 Initialize and Start Services

```bash
# Initialize the isolated environment
./rocketship init

# Start all services
./rocketship start

# Wait for all services to be healthy (2-3 minutes)
./rocketship status
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Stack: rocketship-production
Status: ✓ Running
Services:
  ✓ temporal (healthy)
  ✓ temporal-ui (healthy)
  ✓ postgresql (healthy)
  ✓ elasticsearch (healthy)
  ✓ engine (healthy)
  ✓ worker (healthy)
  ✓ auth-postgres (healthy)

Temporal UI: http://localhost:8080
Engine API: localhost:7700
```

### 3.4 Verify HTTPS Setup

```bash
# Check engine logs for TLS confirmation
./rocketship logs engine | grep -i tls

# Should see: "TLS enabled for gRPC server" domain=localhost
```

---

## 🔑 Step 4: Authentication and Admin Setup

### 4.1 Connect to Your Deployment

After starting the Docker services, you need to create a connection profile:

```bash
# Connect CLI to your Docker deployment (use HTTPS since TLS is enabled)
rocketship connect https://localhost:12100 --name production
```

### 4.2 First Admin Login

```bash
# Login as organization admin
rocketship auth login
```

**Expected Flow:**

1. Browser opens to your identity provider
2. Login with your admin credentials
3. Redirect back to CLI
4. Success message with admin privileges confirmed

```bash
# Verify admin status
./rocketship auth status
```

**Expected Output:**

```
✅ Authenticated as: admin@yourcompany.com
🏢 Organization Role: Organization Admin
🎫 Token expires: [timestamp]
🔗 Connected to: localhost:7700 (HTTPS)
```

### 4.3 Test HTTPS Connection

```bash
# Test basic functionality over HTTPS
rocketship validate examples/simple-http/rocketship.yaml
rocketship run -f examples/simple-http/rocketship.yaml

# Check successful runs
rocketship list
