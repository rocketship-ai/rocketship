# Rocketship Documentation

Welcome to the Rocketship documentation! Rocketship is an open-source API testing framework designed for humans and agents.

## What is Rocketship?

ðŸš€ Rocketship is an **openâ€‘source testing framework** that can verify complex, API-driven scenarios that are made by your customersâ€” or your systems. Today's world is filled with event-driven micro-services that can be hard to test. Rocketship brings durable execution backed by **Temporal** to your testing infra, and offers an extensible plugin system so you can add the APIs and protocols that matter to you.

## Key Features

- **Rocketship CLI** - Run the engine locally or connect to a remote address
- **Deploy-Ready Images** - Need long-running, highly-scalable tests? Or just want to save test history? Host Rocketship on your own infra
- **Declarative YAML** - Define your test scenarios as declarative YAML specs
- **Durable Execution** - Need a test step to retry? Or a test to run for 10 hours? No problem!
- **Plugin Ecosystem** - Add the APIs and protocols that matter to you
