# Rocketship Documentation

Welcome to the Rocketship documentation! Rocketship is an open-source testing framework for APIs and browsers, designed for both humans and coding agents.

## What is Rocketship?

🚀 Rocketship is a **testing tool** that helps you verify your applications work correctly. Think of it as a robot that follows instructions to test your software automatically.

**What can it test?**
- **APIs** - Check if your web services respond correctly to requests
- **Websites** - Automate browser actions like clicking buttons and filling forms
- **Databases** - Verify data is stored and retrieved correctly
- **Complete workflows** - Test entire user journeys across multiple services

**How it works:** You write simple instructions in a YAML file (a human-readable format), and Rocketship executes them. You can run tests on your computer or in the cloud. The tool automatically handles retries, error recovery, and complex scenarios so your tests are reliable.

## Key Features

- **Works Everywhere**: Run tests on your computer, in Kubernetes, or in the cloud
- **Easy Setup**: Switch between different environments with profiles
- **Secure Access**: Built-in authentication for cloud deployments
- **Many Test Types**: Test APIs, databases, websites, and more with specialized plugins
- **Reliable**: Automatically retries failed tests and handles long-running scenarios
- **Flexible**: Use variables to make tests reusable across different environments
