## rocketship validate

Validate Rocketship test files against the JSON schema

### Synopsis

Validate one or more Rocketship test files against the JSON schema.
This command checks test file syntax, structure, and configuration without executing tests.

When validating a directory, only files named "rocketship.yaml" are validated (matching run command behavior).

Examples:
  rocketship validate rocketship.yaml              # Validate a single file
  rocketship validate ./tests/                     # Validate all rocketship.yaml files in directory
  rocketship validate test1.yaml test2.yaml       # Validate multiple files

```
rocketship validate [file_or_directory] [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for validate
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --debug   Enable debug logging
```
