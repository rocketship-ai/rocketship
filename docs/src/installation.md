# Installation

Rocketship CLI is available for macOS, Linux, and Windows. Choose your platform below for installation instructions.

## Prerequisites

If you want to run tests without needing to connect to a remote engine, you need to install Temporal which is required for the local engine:

```bash
brew install temporal  # macOS
```

For other platforms, please follow the [Temporal installation guide](https://docs.temporal.io/cli#install).

```

2. Rename it to `rocketship.exe`
3. Move it to a directory in your PATH (e.g., `C:\Windows\System32\`)

## Docker

Rocketship is also available as a Docker image. It will run the tests you specify then exit:

```bash
docker pull rocketshipai/rocketship:latest
```

To run Rocketship using Docker:

```bash
docker run rocketshipai/rocketship:latest
```

## Verifying Installation

To verify your installation, run:

```bash
rocketship version
```

## Optional: Creating an Alias

If you prefer a shorter command, you can create an alias for the `rocketship` command. Here's how to do it on different platforms:

### Unix-like Systems (macOS, Linux)

Add one of these to your shell's configuration file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
# Alias to "rs"
alias rs="rocketship"
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

Add this to your PowerShell profile:

```powershell
Set-Alias -Name rs -Value rocketship
```

Remember to restart your shell or run `source ~/.bashrc` (or equivalent) to apply the changes.
